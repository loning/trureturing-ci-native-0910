# Minimal Linear Realization from Sequence Data

## Abstract

Finite-rank input-output data constructs its own reachable and observable minimal linear realization, with finite-window rank attainment and an undersized-compression witness.

**Definition 1.1 (Output tail from data).**

Lean statement: `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.dataTail`

*Formalization.* `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.dataTail` (`✓ std3`).

*Source.* Repository-derived.

*Commentary.*

For an input direction u and age j, the i-th future coordinate is m(i+j)u. The data sequence is the only input to this definition.

**Definition 1.2 (Infinite data Hankel column space).**

Lean statement: `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.tailSpace`

*Formalization.* `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.tailSpace` (`✓ std3`).

*Source.* Repository-derived.

*Commentary.*

Take the linear span of all data tails in the full output-sequence space. Finite rank is expressed by FiniteDimensional on this carrier, since natural-valued finrank alone does not detect infinite dimension.

**Definition 1.3 (Shift on output sequences).**

Lean statement: `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.sequenceShift`

*Formalization.* `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.sequenceShift` (`✓ std3`).

*Source.* Repository-derived.

*Commentary.*

The left shift advances a sequence by one coordinate. Its restriction is justified by a proved invariance argument on the data-tail generators.

**Definition 1.4 (A history direction as a state).**

Lean statement: `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.tailState`

*Formalization.* `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.tailState` (`✓ std3`).

*Source.* Repository-derived.

*Commentary.*

A single input direction at a specified age gives a canonical element of the data-tail span.

**Definition 1.5 (Dynamics constructed from data).**

Lean statement: `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.sequenceDynamics`

*Formalization.* `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.sequenceDynamics` (`✓ std3`).

*Source.* Repository-derived.

*Commentary.*

Restrict the left shift to the invariant data-tail span. The map is constructed here; it is not a field requiring a caller-supplied realization.

**Definition 1.6 (Canonical input map).**

Lean statement: `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.sequenceInput`

*Formalization.* `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.sequenceInput` (`✓ std3`).

*Source.* Repository-derived.

*Commentary.*

The input map sends a direction to its unshifted output tail.

**Definition 1.7 (Canonical output map).**

Lean statement: `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.sequenceOutput`

*Formalization.* `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.sequenceOutput` (`✓ std3`).

*Source.* Repository-derived.

*Commentary.*

Evaluate a canonical state at its present coordinate.

**Theorem 1.8 (Iterated dynamics advances coordinates).**

Lean statement: `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.sequenceDynamics_pow_apply`

*Proof.* Machine-checked in Lean as `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.sequenceDynamics_pow_apply` (`✓ std3`). ∎

*Source.* Repository-derived.

*Commentary.*

The n-th iterate of the constructed dynamics sends coordinate i to coordinate i+n, for every state in the tail span.

**Theorem 1.9 (Input iterates are the data tails).**

Lean statement: `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.sequenceDynamics_pow_input`

*Proof.* Machine-checked in Lean as `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.sequenceDynamics_pow_input` (`✓ std3`). ∎

*Source.* Repository-derived.

*Commentary.*

Applying the constructed dynamics n times to an injected input produces precisely the data tail of age n.

**Theorem 1.10 (Every future output reads a coordinate).**

Lean statement: `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.sequenceOutput_pow`

*Proof.* Machine-checked in Lean as `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.sequenceOutput_pow` (`✓ std3`). ∎

*Source.* Repository-derived.

*Commentary.*

Future output at time n equals coordinate n of the canonical state. This identity supplies the distinguishing observation in the compression theorem.

**Theorem 1.11 (All Markov parameters match the supplied data).**

Lean statement: `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.sequence_markovParameter_eq`

*Proof.* Machine-checked in Lean as `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.sequence_markovParameter_eq` (`✓ std3`). ∎

*Source.* Repository-derived.

*Commentary.*

The canonical realization reproduces every m(n), with no modal, eigenvalue, diagonalizability or stability hypothesis.

**Theorem 1.12 (Canonical reachability).**

Lean statement: `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.sequence_reachable_eq_top`

*Proof.* Machine-checked in Lean as `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.sequence_reachable_eq_top` (`✓ std3`). ∎

*Source.* Repository-derived.

*Commentary.*

The input iterates span the entire constructed state space. This is proved by transporting the data-tail generators into the existing reachableSubspace owner.

**Theorem 1.13 (Canonical observability).**

Lean statement: `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.sequence_eventualKernel_eq_bot`

*Proof.* Machine-checked in Lean as `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.sequence_eventualKernel_eq_bot` (`✓ std3`). ∎

*Source.* Repository-derived.

*Commentary.*

A canonical state with zero output at every future time has all coordinates zero. The result uses the existing eventualKernel definition.

**Definition 1.14 (All-future observation of a competing model).**

Lean statement: `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.futureOutput`

*Formalization.* `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.futureOutput` (`✓ std3`).

*Source.* Repository-derived.

*Commentary.*

Map a competing state to the sequence of outputs obtained under repeated application of its dynamics.

**Theorem 1.15 (Every realization contains the data-tail behavior).**

Lean statement: `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.tailSpace_le_futureOutput_range`

*Proof.* Machine-checked in Lean as `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.tailSpace_le_futureOutput_range` (`✓ std3`). ∎

*Source.* Repository-derived.

*Commentary.*

For any realization matching the complete data, every data tail is the future observation of a reachable state. Taking linear spans gives the range inclusion needed for the dimension lower bound.

**Theorem 1.16 (Finite models force finite data rank).**

Lean statement: `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.finite_tailSpace_of_realization`

*Proof.* Machine-checked in Lean as `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.finite_tailSpace_of_realization` (`✓ std3`). ∎

*Source.* Repository-derived.

*Commentary.*

The range of a finite-dimensional state model is finite-dimensional. The proved inclusion therefore forces finite dimensionality of the full data-tail span.

**Theorem 1.17 (A universal linear-state dimension lower bound).**

Lean statement: `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.tailSpace_finrank_le_stateDimension`

*Proof.* Machine-checked in Lean as `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.tailSpace_finrank_le_stateDimension` (`✓ std3`). ∎

*Source.* Repository-derived.

*Commentary.*

Every finite-dimensional realization of the complete sequence has state dimension at least the data-tail dimension. This concerns linear state dimension, not general nonlinear memory or DFA state count.

**Definition 1.18 (A finite realization from finite-rank data).**

Lean statement: `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.realizationFromSequence`

*Formalization.* `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.realizationFromSequence` (`✓ std3`).

*Source.* Repository-derived.

*Commentary.*

Under finite dimensionality of the data-tail span, package the constructed dynamics, input and output in the existing FiniteLinearRealization structure. No pre-existing system is assumed.

**Theorem 1.19 (Finite Hankel rank characterizes finite realizability).**

Lean statement: `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.finite_tailSpace_iff_exists_realization`

*Proof.* Machine-checked in Lean as `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.finite_tailSpace_iff_exists_realization` (`✓ std3`). ∎

*Source.* Repository-derived.

*Commentary.*

The infinite block Hankel column span is finite-dimensional exactly when there is a finite linear realization of the complete sequence. This is an algebraic realization theorem, not an algorithm for noisy finite samples.

**Theorem 1.20 (The lower bound is attained).**

Lean statement: `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.realizationFromSequence_is_minimal`

*Proof.* Machine-checked in Lean as `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.realizationFromSequence_is_minimal` (`✓ std3`). ∎

*Source.* Repository-derived.

*Commentary.*

The named data-only construction matches the sequence and has exactly the data-tail dimension. Every competing finite realization has at least this dimension.

**Definition 1.21 (Finite block Hankel windows from data).**

Lean statement: `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.dataHankel`

*Formalization.* `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.dataHankel` (`✓ std3`).

*Source.* Repository-derived.

*Commentary.*

The block at row i and column j is m(i+j). This definition has no hidden dependence on a supplied state model.

**Theorem 1.22 (Finite windows attain the infinite data rank).**

Lean statement: `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.dataHankel_rank_eq_tailSpace`

*Proof.* Machine-checked in Lean as `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.dataHankel_rank_eq_tailSpace` (`✓ std3`). ∎

*Source.* Repository-derived.

*Commentary.*

When both horizons are at least the tail-space dimension, the finite data Hankel range has exactly that dimension. This theorem consumes the existing stable-Hankel theorem after establishing reachability and observability of the newly constructed model.

**Theorem 1.23 (A witness against undersized linear compression).**

Lean statement: `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.smaller_compression_has_future_witness`

*Proof.* Machine-checked in Lean as `D5/S3/Observer/Hankel/SequenceHankelRealization.smaller_compression_has_future_witness` (`✓ std3`). ∎

*Source.* Repository-derived.

*Commentary.*

Any linear compression to a strictly smaller finite-dimensional space kills some canonical state direction whose output is nonzero at a finite future time. States represent finite linear combinations of histories; no collision between two discrete input words is claimed.
